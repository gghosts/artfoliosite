##AS AN administrator, I aim to produce a combined portfolio page for a local artist with shop capabilities to sell her artwork.<br>
##AS THE artist, I want to access my page, request minor and major edits, receive forms from interested clients, receive funds from and shipping details for purchased items.<br>
##AS THE website viewer, I want to browse the artist's work, learn about them and have the ability to contact them or buy items.<br><br>

##I WANT TO host a place to house her portfolio and current projects. <br>
##I WANT TO offer a site to produce a shopping experience. <br>
##I WANT TO develop an avenue for the conversation to begin; a website to continue the dialogue further, be it a form submission, reroute to the artist's social media or a purchase.<br><br>

##SO THAT the artist's fans and customers can find her and communicate with her <br>
##SO THAT the artist can produce income, achieve independence and success <br><br>

##Future improvement possibilities include fluid shopping experience for user, API linking to Instagram visuals for artist's account (social media growth), SEO-targeting language in meta data on pages (search engine growth/movement, perhaps locally or on another level). <br><br>
