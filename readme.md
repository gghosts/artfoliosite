##AS AN administrator, I aim to produce a combined portfolio page for a local artist with shop capabilities to sell her artwork.
##AS THE artist, I want to access my page, request minor and major edits, receive forms from interested clients, receive funds and shipping details from purchased items.
##AS THE website viewer, I want to browse the artist's work, learn about them and have the ability to contact them or buy items.

##I WANT TO host a place to house her portfolio, current projects.
##I WANT TO offer a site to produce a shopping experience. 
##I want to develop an avenue for the conversation to begin; a website to continue the dialogue further, be it a form submission, reroute to artist's social media or purchase.

##SO THAT the artist's fans and customers can find her and communicate with her
##SO THAT the artist can produce income, achieve independence and success 

##Future improvement possibilities include fluid shopping experience for user, API linking to Instagram visuals for artist's account (social media growth), SEO-targeting language in meta data on pages (search engine growth/movement, perhaps locally or on another level).
