Artfolio site for a local artist that showcases their portfolio as well as offering shopping capabilities for clients. <br><br>

##User Story (a)<br>
##AS THE artist<br>
##I WANT TO access my page, request minor and major edits, receive forms from interested clients, receive funds from and shipping details for purchased items.<br>
##SO THAT my fans and customers can find and communicate with me, engage in my artwork, share and purchase it. <br>

##User Story (b)<br>
##AS THE website viewer (potential client)<br>
##I WANT TO browse the artist's work, learn about them and have the ability to contact them<br>
##SO THAT I can connect with them on social or decide to buy items, request specific frame sizes, etc.<br>

##User Story (c)<br>
##AS THE website viewer (potential collaborator)
##I WANT TO browse the artist's work, learn about their education and certifications and also view their portfolio. I also want the ability to contact them to suggest a collaboration or follow them on social media. <br>
##SO THAT I can decide if I want to work with them on a future project or recommend them as a commission to a client. <br>

##User Story (d)<br>
##AS AN Administrator <br>
##I WANT TO produce a combined portfolio page for a local artist with shop capabilities to sell her artwork.<br>
##SO THAT the artist can continue the dialogue further, be it a form submission, reroute to the artist's social media or a purchase.<br>

##Future improvement possibilities include fluid shopping experience for user, API linking to Instagram visuals for artist's account (social media growth), SEO-targeting language in meta data on pages (search engine growth/movement, perhaps locally or on another level). <br><br>
